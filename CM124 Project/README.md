# Haplophaser
The Haplophaser2.m (Octave compatible code) and Haplophaser3.m (original MATLAB code) functions are renditions of the expectation-maximization algorithm for haplotype phasing with partition-ligatoin.

input is the input file for the to-be-phased genotype.
output is the ourput file for the predicted haplotypes.
partition_size is how many SNPs will be phased at a time in each partition.
